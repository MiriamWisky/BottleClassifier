# BottleClassifier
This project focuses on classifying 5 types of bottles using deep learning techniques.
Two approaches were explored: training a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch and fine-tuning a pre-trained ResNet50 model.
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes synthetic images of bottles and was divided into training and testing sets.
The goal of the project was to optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning and to compare the effectiveness of training a model from scratch versus leveraging a pre-trained model.

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle:
